# SARIF API Validator

This script checks the findings.json file exported from the SARIF API. Just run:

python3 sarif_validator.py
```

If everything meets the standard, you'll see success messages. If something is wrong, the script will tell you what needs fixing.

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. No extra libraries needed.
